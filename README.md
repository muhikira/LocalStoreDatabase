In this project I will create a small retail outlet store in the small community to help them build a small database that will help them track customers, products and orders placed. 
I will be using SpringBoot, Java and MySQL Database.

I will make sure that  i correctly identify the primary key fields in my code that are required to create the tables. 
I Provide clear comments in the code.
